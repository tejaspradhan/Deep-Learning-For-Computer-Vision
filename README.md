# Deep-Learning-For-Computer-Vision
A series of small projects where deep neural network based approaches have been applied to computer vision problems like Image Classification.
The models have been built using Tensorflow and Keras.  

## Datasets :
- MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) Dataset for Handwritten Digit Recognition
- Fashion MNIST Dataset for classifying clothing images
